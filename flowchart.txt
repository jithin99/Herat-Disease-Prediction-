Notebook
-------------
 
1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset 
    Heart Disease Data
3. Data Processing
4. Data Visualization
5. Selecting the X and y  Data
6. Data Sampling 
    Adasyn Oversampling
7. Splitting the dataset
8. Building the model for all data
    LeNet
    GRU
    EnsCVDDNet - LeNet + GRU
    BICVDD-Net - LeNet + GRU + ANN
    CNN
    LSTM
    BiLSTM
    CNN + LSTM
    KNN
    XGBoost
    LR
    NaiveBayes
    DecisionTree
    Voting Classifier (RF+BagwithEt+BoostedDT)

9. Training and Building the model
10. Comparing the models with accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score
11. Comparison graphs are generated with scores of all models.

FrontEnd
------------

12. Frontend is developed with help of Flask Framework, along with Registration and Login setup with support of Sqlite DB
13. For the frontend we have used dataset for predicting the Heart Disease
14. User gives input as Feature Values 
15. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
16. Trained model is used for predicting the heart disease
17. Final outcome is displayed through frontend


Extension
----------
In the base paper the author mentioned to use EnsCVDD-Net and BICVDD-Net model  for analysis the data and compared with other models, 
As an extension we applied an ensemble method  combining the predictions of multiple individual models to produce a more robust and accurate final prediction. 
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other ensemble techniques such as CNN+LSTM,Voting Classifier
As an extension we can build the front end using the flask framework for user testing and with user authentication.
